# Spring cloud config client enable issue

This project demonstrates the issue with disabling spring cloud config on a specific profile, but not only.

## üôÇ Expected behavior

When the spring cloud config client is disabled by setting the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property to `false`, the config servers that are already configured are ignored.

## üôÅ Observed behavior

Even if the spring cloud config client is disabled, the config server endpoint gets called, and a decision to fail the application startup process is made based on the `isOptional` and `isNotFailFast` flags.

## ‚èØ Run

Try to run this demo with no profile selected 

```shell
gradle bootRun
```

and then with the `dev` profile selected, where the cloud config was explicitly disabled.

```shell
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev gradle bootRun
```

## üëä How to fix

A possible fix would be to check for the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property in [`ConfigServerConfigDataLoader.java`](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/blob/1210effa445ba9f30004e34bde8262d35621cd9f/spring-cloud-config-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/config/client/ConfigServerConfigDataLoader.java#L77) before doing any logic, and simply return if the config client is disabled.
